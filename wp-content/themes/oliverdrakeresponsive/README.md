Child's Play, for the Thematic Theme Framework
===============

Child's Play is built with the Responsive Base child theme which is built on the mobile-first approach to responsive web design. It is unique in that it is a SASS/Compass child theme for Thematic, it is my first attempt at playing with CSS preprocessors. It includes all the benefits of the Responsive Base Theme, but incorporates WooThemes Flexslider, adds a header widget and has a much better visual appeal

It is intended to work best with the latest version of Thematic 1.0+, but works on 9.7.7 and above.
