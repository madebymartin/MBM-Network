Responsive Base, for the Thematic Theme Framework
===============

Responsive Base is a child theme built on the mobile first approach to responsive web design. It was created to act as a template or starting point for child theming with the Thematic Theme Framework and WordPress. It is perfect for beginners who want a head start with responsive themes for Thematic.

It is intended to work best with the latest version of Thematic. 

This theme also plays nice with the Thematic HTML5 Plugin available at http://wordpress.org/plugins/thematic-html5/ which helps give you a very modern HTML5 to go along with your responsive theme.
